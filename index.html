    <h1>Phocus: Todo List Example</h1>

    <div data-phocus-context-name="todo-list" class="list">
      <ul id="list"></ul>
      <div data-phocus-context-name="todo-item-form" class="new-item-form">
        <input type="text" id="new-item-form" data-phocus-id="new-item-form" />
        <button data-phocus-action="add"></button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="descriptive-text">
      <p>Phocus manages actions, hotkeys, and focus for poweruser-friendly, accessible webapps.</p>

      <p>This is an absolutely pared-down example of how to use Phocus. Phocus is
        not intended to be used stand-alone like this; it's intended to be paired
        with the frontend framework of your choice. A wrapper for react is available: <a href="https://github.com/diiq/react-phocus">react-phocus</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Things to note:
        <ul>
          <li>Todo items are focusable, and when focused, you can use contextual hotkeys to manipulate them; try 's' to
            start a task, or 'backspace' to delete one.</li>
          <li>Try using the arrow keys, or j and k, to move between list items, or Control+n to focus on the new item
            input</li>
          <li><span tabindex="0" data-phocus-id="todo-item-2" style="color: blue">This text</span> has the same phocus-id as one of the
            todo items, but phocus never mistakenly focuses on it instead.</li>
          <li>In the source, none of these buttons have text; empty buttons are given default labels by Phocus.</li>
          <li>Buttons are given aria labels and tooltips which describe their behavior, and any relevant keyboard
            shortcut. A screenreader will read the &times; button as "Delete (backspace)".</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
